# snowmobile

`snowmobile` is a simple set of modules for streamlined interaction with the Snowflake Database for Data Scientists and Business Analysts.

As such the included codes are intended to be used for the execution of raw SQL or with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames and don't make use of an ORM to 
map Python objects to tabular Snowflake counterparts. 

A quick overview of simplified usage is outlined below.

---
## Basic usage
1. Install with `pip install snowmobile`

2. Create file called *snowflake_credentials.json* following the below structure with as many sets of credentials
as desired and store anywhere on local file system
    ```json
    {
   "Connection1": {
        "username":	"",
        "password":	"",
        "role": "",
        "account": "",
        "warehouse": "warehouse #1",
        "database":	"database #1",
        "schema": "schema #1"
      },"SANDBOX": {
        "username":	"",
        "password":	"",
        "role": "",
        "account": "",
        "warehouse": "warehouse #1",
        "database":	"database #1",
        "schema": "SANDBOX"
      }
    }
   ```
  
3. Import module for the use-case and execute simplified commands
    ```python
    # <bundled authentication & statement-execution>  
    from snowmobile import snowquery
      
    # Instantiate an instance of a connection
    sandbox_conn = snowquery.Connector(conn_name='SANDBOX')
      
    # Execute statements on that connection 
    sample_df = sandbox_conn.execute_query('SELECT * FROM SAMPLE_TABLE')
    
    # Manipulate DataFrame
    transposed_df = sample_df.transpose() 
   
    # Instantiate a different connection
    user_conn = snowquery.Connector(conn_name='user_schema')
   
    # <flexible loading solution>
    from snowmobile import snowloader
    
    # Load to different location
    snowloader.df_to_snowflake(df=transposed_df, table_name='LATEST_SAMPLE', 
                               connector=user_conn, force_recreate=True)
   
    # Locate a bunch of sql files to execute
    import os
    paths_to_sql = [os.path.join(file, path) for file in os.listdir(path)]
    
    # <script parsing and execution>
    from snowmobile import snowscripter 
    
    # Creating connected script objects from paths on a specified connection
    script_objs = [snowscripter.Script(path, connector=user_conn) for path in paths_to_sql]
    
    # Run all scripts sequentially
    for script in script_objs:
       print(f"Running {script.source}")
       script.run()
    ```

# Modules


All modules are included in the build for transparency & flexibility purposes, although the majority of use-cases will run on the front-end modules that make use of the others along the way.

#### Front-end / primary utilities 
- `snowquery` instantiates a connection and provides an `execute_query()` method for executing statements against and querying data from the warehouse
- `snowloader` flexibly loads data from a local DataFrame into a table within the warehouse in the form of a `df_to_snowflake()` function, bundling a variety of utilities that standardize column names pre-loading, check DataFrame's structure compared to the table to be loaded into, and executes 
DDL in absence of a pre-existing table 
- `snowscripter` parses and instantiates components of raw .sql scripts into Python objects for much easier interaction, particularly as it relates to single-statement execution and rendering statements as markdown when executed in IPython environments as well as easy execution of full .sql files


#### Back-end / supporting
- `snowcreds` locates the credentials file on a user's local file system
- `snowconn` establishes a connection to the database and returns a **conn** object

A more in-depth description of of each module and its usage outlined below.

---
# snowquery

`snowquery` simplifies the execution of sql statements against the database via an `execute_query()` 
method, using [pandas'](https://pandas.pydata.org/) `pd.read_sql` function to execute the SQL and  returning results from the DataBase as a [dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) by default.

**please note**: `snowquery` is intended to streamline execution of sql that is typed *within* a Python script
and is better-suited for ad-hoc statements whereas `snowscripter` imports an external .sql file & extracts its components into Python objects that come with cleaner methods for execution.


### Usage
Its usage to query via set of credentials stored in _snowflake_credentials.json_ labeled **SANDBOX** is as follows.

```python
In[1]:
from snowmobile import snowquery

# Establishes snowquery.Connector() object with which statements can be excuted 
sf = snowquery.Connector(conn_name='SANDBOX')

# Executing a simple sql string
sample = sf.execute_query('select * from sample_sandbox_table')

# Verifying returned object
type(sample)
```
```
Out[1]
pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
```

---
# snowscripter

`snowscripter` imports an external .sql file & transforms it into Python objects on which methods can be called to perform a variety of actions.

The `Script` object is instantiated with the following three arguments, of which only `path` is required for successful instantiation.

```python
    def __init__(self, path: str, pattern: str = r"/\*-(\w.*)-\*/",
                 connector: snowquery.Connector = ''):
        """Instantiating an instance of 'script' by calling Script class on a
        full path to a sql script.

        Args:
            path: Full path to SQL script including .sql extension
            pattern: Regex pattern that SQL statement headers are wrapped in
            connector: Instantiated snowquery.Connector instance to use in the
            execution of Script or Statement objects
        """ 
```

The usage for this module is broken up into **script-level** and **statement-level** usage below, the latter of which contains the majority of application.

---
## Usage (script-level)

In its simplest form, users can instantiate an instance of `script` by running the below where _path_ is a full file path to a .sql file.

```python
script = snowscripter.Script(path)
```

This will return a Script object on which the `.run()` method can be called to execute an entire script  sequentially statement by statement.

---
## Usage (statement-level)

#### Background
The real benefit of `snowscripter` comes from the use of 'header' tags within the sql script that form a link between a specified name and an individual statement - these are identified in the parser by the regex pattern contained in the `pattern` argument of the object's instantiation.

The pattern's default is '**/\\\*-(\\w.*)-\\\*/**'  and will return all text between a standard sql block-comment whose contents are wrapped in an additional '-', such as:

```mysql
/*-sample_statement_header-*/
select 
   a.*
from...
```

To make this more clear, a usage example is outlined in the below in which `scriptparser` is
used to transform a few simple sql statements and execute them against a sample table loaded in the warehouse.


---
## `Snowmobile.scriptparser` Example Usage


### Setup / creating data

The following Python snippet creates a dummy DataFrame and loads it to the warehouse for use during the exercise

```python
# Up-front setup for snowscripter usage
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from snowmobile import snowloader, snowquery

# Creating dummy df 
df = pd.DataFrame({f"col{i}": 
                   np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000) for i in range(0, 10)}).reset_index()

# Instantiating instance of a specified connection to run on for demo 
demo_conn = snowquery.Connector('demo')

# Loading into a table called SAMPLE_TABLE
snowloader.df_to_snowflake(df, table_name='SAMPLE_TABLE', force_recreate=True, connector=demo_conn)
```


### 1. Local sql script (snowscripter_sample.sql)

Now that we have a sample table to query against, consider two statements stored in the .sql file
below.

```mysql
--snowscripter_sample.sql

/*-contrived_example_aggregation-*/
create or replace temp table index_agg as with
contrived_1 as (
  select
    index
    ,sum(col1) as col1
  from SAMPLE_TABLE
  group by 1
),
contrived_2 as (
  select
    index
    ,sum(col1) as col2
  from SAMPLE_TABLE
  group by 1
)
  select
    a.*
    ,b.col2
  from contrived_1 a
  inner join contrived_2 b
    on a.index = b.index;

/*-verify_contrived_join-*/
SELECT
  index
	,count(*)
		as cnt_all
FROM index_agg
group by 1
having count(*) <> 1;
```

### 2. Instantiating parsed script object

In Python, we can instantiate a `snowscripter.Script` object from this file with:
```python
from snowmobile import snowscripter
  
# path_to_script = full path to .sql file
script = snowscripter.Script(path_to_script, snowflake=demo_conn)
```


### 3. Accessing & executing statements

Now that we have a `script` object in memory, we can work with different parts of our script
either through the `script` object or extracting individual `Statement` objects & their associated methods.

**Note**: It's technically possible to access each statement as a raw string by pulling it out of
the `script` object's namespace with:
```python
script.statement.get('contrived_example_aggregation')
```
However, this isn't recommended as manually executing all those strings is significantly less convenient
than the following two options outlined below.

---
**Option 1**: Access as a `Statement` object via the script's `.fetch()` method

```python
sample_statement_obj = script.fetch('contrived_example_aggregation')
type(sample_statement_obj)  # snowmobile.snowscripter.Statement
```
This method is preferred because the `snowmobile.snowscripter.Statement` object comes with the following three methods:
- `.execute()` to execute
- `.render()` to render the syntactically-highlighted code as a markdown in IPython environments 
- `.raw()` to return the raw sql as a string

**Option 2**: Access `Statement` objects for all statements via the script's `.get_statements()` method

This will return an iterable containing individual `Statement` objects for all statements in the script

```python
iterable_statements = script.get_statements()
for statement_header, statement in iterable_statements.items():
  # 'statement_header' will iterate through [contrived_example_aggregation, verify_contrived_join]
  # 'statement' will be the Statement objects associated with each of the headers
```

---

### 4. Executing and rendering statements simultaneously
Lastly, it's often helpful to execute a statement as well as render the sql behind it
or see descriptions of results, particularly when troubleshooting a broken pipeline or
trying to determine at what point in a lengthy sql script the data stops representing what 
we think it does. 

To avoid the need to call multiple methods in these instances, the `.execute()` method 
is defined with the following arguments allowing for this flexibility.
```python
    def execute(self, results: bool = True, render: bool = False,
                describe: bool = False) -> object:
        """Executes sql with option to return results / render sql as Markdown.

        Args:
            results: Boolean indicating whether or not to
            return results
            render: Boolean indicating whether or not to render the
            raw sql as markdown
            describe: Boolean indicating whether or not to
            print output of a pandas df.describe() on returned results (mostly
            useful for QA queries that are expected to return null-sets)
        """
```

Resulting in the following functionality within **IPython/Jupyter** environments

# snowloader
`snowloader` streamlines the bulk-loading protocol outlined in the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-overview.html)
in the form of a `df_to_snowflake()` function and is intended to be a one-stop solution for the quick loading of data.

Its main features are:
- Standardizing of DataFrame's columns prior to loading into the warehouse
- DDL creation & execution if a pre-defined table to load data into doesn't exist 
- Parameter-based flexibility to append DataFrame's contents or replace pre-existing contents
- Returns a boolean indicating whether or not a load was successful for exception-handling when iteratively loading/appending multiple files
into a single table.

## Usage

Continuing on the above example, the below will convert all columns in the _sample_table_ DataFrame to floats 
and load it into the warehouse, executing new-DDL to overwrite an existing table or create one in its absence.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from snowmobile import snowloader, snowquery

# Instantiating instance of a specified connection to run on for demo 
demo_conn = snowquery.Connector('demo')

# Selecting all value from dummy table created in 'snowscripter' usage
df = demo_conn.execute_query('select * from sample_table')

# Converting all numeric values to floats (index dropping/adding to handle
# the index along the way/not change the structure of the final table)
df = df.drop(columns=[col for col in df.columns if 'index' in 
                      col]).reset_index()
df = df.applymap(float).reset_index()

# Option 1 
snowloader.df_to_snowflake(df=df, table_name='SAMPLE_TABLE', force_recreate=True,
                            snowflake=demo_conn)

# Option 2 
snowloader.df_to_snowflake(df=df, table_name='SAMPLE_TABLE', force_recreate=True)
```

In the above,
- *Option 1* will load the data back into Snowflake on the same connection that was established in the
  `sf = snowquery.Snowflake(conn_name='SANDBOX')` statement by use of the `snowflake=sf` parameter
- In *Option 2* this argument is omitted and the function will instantiate a new connection based on the first set of credentials in **snowflake_credentials.json**


In general and particularly when iteratively loaded multiple files into the database, it will be faster to instantiate a single instance of `snowquery`
that's passed into the `df_to_snowflake()` function so that it does not need to find, read-in and parse the credentials file each time its called.

---
# snowcreds

### Description

`snowcreds` is a single class intentionally extracted for easier evolving along with security standards, 
its instantiation of `Credentials()` accepts the below two arguments and associated defaults
```python
def __init__(self, config_file: str = 'snowflake_credentials.json',
                 conn_name: str = '') -> None:
        """Instantiates an instance of credentials file.
        
        Args:
            config_file: Name of .json configuration file following the
            format of connection_credentials_SAMPLE.json.
            conn_name: Name of connection within json file to use, will
            use first set of credentials in the file if no argument is passed.
        """
        self.config_file = config_file
        self.conn_name = conn_name
```

It contains a single `.get()` method that will traverse a user's file system from the bottom-up until it finds a filename
that matches the `config_file` parameter and unless specified otherwise via the `conn_name` parameter will return the first set of credentials
stored in the **.json** file.  

*The .json file itself is assumed to store its credentials following [this](https://github.com/GEM7318/Snowmobile/blob/master/connection_credentials_SAMPLE.json) format*
<br></br>

### Usage

**Note**: The instantiation of `snowcreds` is somewhat verbose and has been left us such for the time being as it is a back-end utility and not intended
to be called by the users explicitly

```python
In[1]:
from snowmobile import snowcreds
creds = snowcreds.Credentials(config_file='sample_credentials.json').get()
```
```
Out[1]:
Locating & importing credentials..
	<1 of 4> Searching for sample_credentials.json in local file system..
	<2 of 4> Located & loaded sample_credentials.json from:
		C:\User\Desktop\sample_credentials.json
	<3 of 4> No explicit connection passed, fetching 'Connection1' credentials by default
	<4 of 4> Successfully imported credentials for conn_name='Connection1'
```

---
# snowconn

### Description
`snowconn` is also comprised of a single class, `Connection()`, that inherits `Credentials()` to retrieve a set of credentials with which to establish a connection to the database.

Its instantiation and usage is very similar to `snowcreds` as it inherits the `config_file` and `conn_name` attributes and includes a `.get_conn()` method will authenticate using the credentials
returned by `snowcreds.get()`

### Usage

The below codes instantiate an instance of Connection used in higher-level modules.

```python
In[1]:
from snowmobile import snowconn
creds = snowconn.Connection().get_conn()
type(creds)
```
```
Out[1]:
snowflake.connector.connection.SnowflakeConnection
```
